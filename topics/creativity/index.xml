      <description>Origin Story I received an email from a colleague currently on sabbatical. I thought about how interesting it must be to go to a different place and try out new lines of research. This prompted the question, &amp;ldquo;Why are sabbaticals so infrequent?&amp;rdquo;
Summary Using the Strategic Inventive Thinking principle of division, I would split sabbaticals up and make them smaller but more frequent. Imagine the recombinatory power of faculty getting out and trying something new on a regular basis.</description>
