      <description>Origin Story Attending the self-reliance training on Sunday, I participated in a condensed version of a self-reliance group meeting that was guided by the Foundations curriculum. The lesson we reviewed used a brief ponder activity at the beginning: reading a scripture from John and reflecting on its meaning. Doing something like this at the start of TCMs or class would help set the tone for discussion.
Summary Start class, TCMs, presidency meetings, (suggest in) couple counsels with a relevant verse of scripture and a simple application question.</description>

      <description>Origin Story Listening to a news podcast on the way home yesterday, I recognized an opportunity to talk about Walmart&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; grocery pickup service and Lego&amp;rsquo;s recent challenges. Imagine how refreshing it would be to bring in recent news items and throw it out to the class.
Summary As I am reading/listening to current events during the week, identify connections to course concepts. Use these to jumpstart a discussion in class.</description>

      <description>Considerations  Create a rubric and stick to 5% breaks in scores. Range from 80 to 100, possibly using 80 in exceptional cases only. The distribution should be similar to the final grade distribution.</description>
