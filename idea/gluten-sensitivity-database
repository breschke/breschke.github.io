## Origin Story

I was conducting customer validation in the afternoon break for 490R Sat, Feb 20, 2016 12:47. My focus this month is on people experiencing gluten intolerance (Cami).

## Summary

 [The Gluten Free Agency](http://thegluten-freeagency.com/gluten-free-market-trends/) alerted me to the fact that there is a sizable subset of people who experience gluten intolerance and still eat some gluten: 12 million of 40 million estimated consumers in the gluten-free market. The market is growing rapidly: \$10.5bn in 2013 with expected 48% annual growth rate (Mintel). (Compare with Packaged Facts' estimate: \$4.2 bn 2012 but similar estimated growth rate).

 Is there a systematic zone of gluten tolerability that could be better served? Hypotheses:

 * `$H_0$:` Some people experiencing gluten intolerance can still eat gluten if it is regulated (feasibility). Call these 'intoleaters'.
      * Is it about amount eaten in a given meal (initial concentration) or within a certain time period?
      * Is it certain types of gluten?
      * Can the 'safe zone' be identified systematically?
 * `$H_0$:` Intoleaters want to track the amount of gluten they have eaten in a given period in order to consume more gluten.

### Motivations for eating gluten-free

(Probably not a representative sample.)
