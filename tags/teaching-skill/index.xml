      <description>Origin Story Attending the self-reliance training on Sunday, I participated in a condensed version of a self-reliance group meeting that was guided by the Foundations curriculum. The lesson we reviewed used a brief ponder activity at the beginning: reading a scripture from John and reflecting on its meaning. Doing something like this at the start of TCMs or class would help set the tone for discussion.
Summary Start class, TCMs, presidency meetings, (suggest in) couple counsels with a relevant verse of scripture and a simple application question.</description>
