      <description>Origin Story In a discussion with Ben Beck in office hours Mon, Apr 4, 2016 3:45 PM, we considered the pain of gardening. He is currently focusing on a smart app to inform gardeners when to plant, water, fertilize, etc.
Summary An alternate pain hypothesis is that time required to garden is a deep pain. A rather complex solution would be coordinating the labor market for gardening talent.
Next Directions TO DO: Draft use of this case in the hypothesis building workshop for Seattle.</description>

“The foremost sociological characteristic of competition is the fact that conflict in it is indirect.”
“parallel efforts by both parties concerning the same prize”
S distinguishes between the subjective goal and objective result of competition. The prize competitors seek is in the hands of neither.
S focuses on competition where the only adversary in is the aim.</description>
