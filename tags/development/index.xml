      <description>What if Tina Grey&amp;rsquo;s process for writing (public, recorded, evaluated?) were applied to generating new ideas. Could we see that sharing ideas (at least the act of articulating them to a public audience) improves (a) volume (b) quality &amp;copy; actionability? I&amp;rsquo;m interested in trying it out with my students and potentially enlisting OB 321 classes in this.</description>

      <description>Context: Chad&amp;rsquo;s class Mon, Feb 8, 2016 11:00 - What if we asked people to estimate perceived market share of a company? Assess: does market share even matter to customers? Is a discrepancy between perceived and actual market share substantive?</description>

      <description>While observing Chad&amp;rsquo;s class (Mon, Feb 8, 2016 11:00 AM) in which he led a discussion of Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPod vs. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s zune, I wondered: when, if ever, is it bad to create the dominant design in an industry? I would like to learn more about this kind of thing.</description>

      <title>Research Idea: Sounding Liberal</title>

      <description>Study the transcripts of presidential debates. Assess the extent to which candidates conform to latent codes of what it is to be conservative or liberal. What about moderates? This could be a natural extension of what I am doing with LLL, and would be something for a more sociological outlet.

      <title>Status Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://breschke.github.io/writing/status-spillovers/</link>

      <description>When an actor experiences a sudden gain in status — for example, when a scientist wins a Nobel Prize, or a film director wins an Oscar — what does this jump in status do to the fates of the winner’s many ‘neighbors’? Do non-winners bask in the reflected glory of the winner, and therefore rise with her? Or conversely, does competition for attention ensue, attenuating the recognition neighbors otherwise would have received?</description>
