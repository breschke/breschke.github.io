      <description>We are on the hook to submit an abstract to NEC this Friday. I have a call with Joel on Thursday. Tasks take roughly the following priority:
 Percentile rank for various career variables Assess degree of left-censoring in career histories Narrow sample to star-lit alters only Assess how this addresses extreme values. If necessary, drop top 0.1 percentile. Descriptive statistics for stocks that ever have a star Control observation for each star-lit alter Brokerage stats  Trello</description>
