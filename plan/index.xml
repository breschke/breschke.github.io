      <description>Abstract: The following plan was developed as part of the Faculty Development Series at Brigham Young University. The intent of this plan is to aid my development in scholarship, teaching, and citizenship over the coming academic year, and to set a foundation for my continued contribution to the mission and aims of BYU. For each professional area—scholarship, teaching, and citizenship—I provide (a) a self-assessment of my performance and abilities, and (b) goals and plans for the year.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The following report describes my course development for BUS M 470: Entrepreneurial Innovation.

Course Background I teach Business Management 470: Entrepreneurial Innovation. This is among the first set of courses undergraduate entrepreneurship majors take after being accepted into the major. Additionally, students from other Marriott School of Management majors (strategy, organizational behavior and human resources) take this course as an elective. The purpose of the course is to help students engage in entrepreneurship in an intentional, systematic way, and to gain confidence in their ability to identify and innovate solutions for problems.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The following report evaluates my progress towards goals for scholarly development through February 2017.

Goal Progress In the course of the Faculty Development Series, I set three goals for my scholarly development through the beginning of the Winter 2017 semester. As I review my progress towards each goal below, I identify ways that applied the scholarly strategies identified in my Faculty Development Plan. I also identify new insights gleaned from the experience of reviewing my progress, and I articulate plans for future productivity.</description>

      <description>We are on the hook to submit an abstract to NEC this Friday. I have a call with Joel on Thursday. Tasks take roughly the following priority:
 Percentile rank for various career variables Assess degree of left-censoring in career histories Narrow sample to star-lit alters only Assess how this addresses extreme values. If necessary, drop top 0.1 percentile. Descriptive statistics for stocks that ever have a star Control observation for each star-lit alter Brokerage stats  Trello</description>

      <description>Considerations  Create a rubric and stick to 5% breaks in scores. Range from 80 to 100, possibly using 80 in exceptional cases only. The distribution should be similar to the final grade distribution.</description>

      <description> It seems we need to spend more time on how to use prototypes in validation. Getting feedback, good and bad, is crucial to this process. Seeing that we can build it is only part of the prototyping process.
Questions  How can prototypes best elicit customer feedback?     </description>
